Proposed ideas for improvement of the HDX platform:
- Remove the ‘transfer value per household’ figure.
- Add in IDPs to the reporting (if feasible) – possibly adding to the rural/urban classification (to be discussed with IM WG by Albert)
- Clearly label when the data was updated and which month it refers to.
- Add in a line or column graph tracking total beneficiary numbers and total USD transferred by month, plus any other figures possibly traceable over time.
- Add in a few ‘methodological notes’ explaining how beneficiary numbers are counted and how total transfer is calculated
- If the raw data (excel) is directly downloadable from the platform, I’d strongly advise you summarise it at district level and remove the transfer values as it could be sensitive information
